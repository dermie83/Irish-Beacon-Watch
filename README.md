## üåê API Connectivity

This application integrates with external APIs to enhance functionality and provide real-time data. It uses the [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) API to fetch weather information based on location data. For mapping and geolocation, the app leverages [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), an open-source and community-driven mapping service. These APIs enable dynamic user experiences such as location-based weather forecasts and interactive maps.
